# WAX

This repository contains human association explanation for the [WAX](WAX__A_novel_dataset_for_Word_Association_eXplanations.pdf) dataset. We presents the dataset and the code for probing to what extent current pre-trained language models capture the underlying relations.

## Introduction 
Word associations are among the most common paradigms for studying the  human mental lexicon. While their structure and types of associations have been well studied, surprisingly little attention has been given to the question of *why* participants produce the observed associations.

We introduce a large, crowd-sourced dataset of English word associations with explanations, labeled with high-level relation types. An example from WAX is shown in Figure 1 (top), bagpipe and kilt is associated is because *"Bagpipe players often wear kilts." ,* which is labelled with a Thematic relation label. The framework of collecting WAX is shown on the bottom of Figure 1.

WAX consists of  1.1K cues with 1.9K explanations, among which 1.5K are relation-labelled.

### Key Challenges 
Word association understanding is challenge is because:

(1) The underlying association reasons are often diverse and unknown.

<!-- Some examples
* clear,glass,the glass in my window is clear.
* comedy, laughter, when you watch a comedy you have a lot of laughter.
* creak,wood,the wood started to creak as people stepped on it 
* mixed,drinks,drinks are often mixed with multiple different fluids.
* mixed,bag,the movie was a mixed bag. -->

(2) the uncertainty of single or multiple relations existing in the association reasons/explanations. For example, pocket and wallet are consistently associated with a single reason (AtLocation), while hurricane and disaster are associated with different relations (ResultIn and CategoryExemplar).

WAX allows us to study whether two words are consistently associated with the same relation type (relation unambiguous; Ex1) or with different relation types (relation ambiguous; Ex 2). 


# Repository Structure

## **WAX Dataset** 
You can download the WAX dataset from [WAX.csv](WAX.csv) . This file includes 4 columns:
* cue: the cue concept/words that we used to stimulate people. 
* association: the association collected from workers. 
* explanation: the explanations generated by workers who generate the association.
* relation: the relation label for explanations, the value in this column is either (1)one of the 16 relation labels for explanations, which are the majority label from five annotators; (2) or **UNK**, which means that the relations of explanations are unlabelled. 



## **Relation Classification**
The relation classification folder contains the code for the the task of relation classification.

### Installation 
### Train and Test
#### BERT 
#### BART 

## **Explanation Generation**
The explanation generation folder contains the code for the task of generating explanations.

#### BART 



We present an analysis of the provided explanations, and design several tasks to probe to what extent current pre-trained language models capture the underlying relations.

 Our experiments show that models struggle to capture the {diversity} of human  associations, suggesting \wax is a rich benchmark for commonsense modeling and generation.

Answering this question would not only advance understanding of human cognition, but could also aid machines in learning and representing basic commonsense knowledge.

WAX is a new dataset collected for better human understanding.

It contains 1.9K human self-explanations expressed in natural language sentences. A subset of them are labelled with high-level relation labels.

WAX is challenging because it
